Ok, here it is!

These are the files for the DeltaStarliner G42 variant of the DGa2 SSTO project for Orbiter

the G42, is the MASTER VARIANT - maintained my me (Moach) and should be left unaltered - all changesshould be pushed as new branches, named after the respective variant therein...

this is for two reasons, first: the master variant should always be in a working state, second: i won't double-check before pushing my work into this branch, so changes may be ruthlessly overwitten...

so leave the G42 branch as is... i'll worry about it ;)


other than that, go nutz!
the idea of having "variants" is to allow you to take the project wherever ways you choose and not have to worry about others agreeing with it or not 

please add a README like this one to your variants describing how they are different from the G42 master - this way, whatever awesome features i find fitting, can be merged into it :) 


i strongly recommend taking your time to learn git, it is a very awesome tool - plus, if you wanna upload any changes you've made to the project, you'll need it anyways


*note* you don't need git if you just wanna take 'er for a ride - you can download the files from the 'download source' button above ad install it like any other addon



cheerz,

Moach
